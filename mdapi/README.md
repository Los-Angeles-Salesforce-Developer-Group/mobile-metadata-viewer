# Metadata API Folder
This folder is a placeholder to retrieve the contents of the managed package from the packaging org in mdapi format using the
```
sfdx force mdapi retrieve -s -r ./mdapi -u mobile-metadata-viewer -p "Mobile Metadata Viewer"
```
command.  This is really only helpful to the author (me) since I'm the only one who has access to the packaging org (for now).
It's shown here for transparency and learning purposes.
